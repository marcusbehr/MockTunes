# MockTunes
Final project for CSCI 2082

This MockTunes project was done in the Java language

Consists of a Song, Library, Playlist, Store, Review, and FileWork class
These classes allow a user to select a song from the store and add that song to their
library. A user can then select the song from the library and play that song.

The playlist option allows a user to create a playlist that will play song after song until 
playlist is complete. The playlist uses a queue to play back songs as the user added them

Note: The songs were played from MP3's stored in the project file in the workbench and 
the songs were linked by matching the name of the file with the name in the Song object
